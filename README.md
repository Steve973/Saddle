# Saddle
Saddle provides an easy and convenient way to ride the Camel!  Run Apache Camel as a standalone application
without the need to develop or manage a separate application to keep the context(s) running. It provides a
shell to interact with the application, which provides the ability to add contexts, control them, and get
status of the contexts.
